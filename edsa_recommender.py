People are always short on time with the myriad tasks they need to accomplish in the limited 24 hours. Recommender systems are socially and economically critical for ensuring that individuals can make appropriate choices surrounding the content they engage with on a daily basis. Therefore, the recommendation systems are important as they help them make the right choices.
                    The purpose of a recommendation system is to search for content that would be interesting to an individual. Moreover, it involves a number of factors to create personalised lists of useful and interesting content specific to each user.Another objective of the recommendation system is to achieve customer loyalty by providing relevant content and maximising the time spent by a user on your website or channel
